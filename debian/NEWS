xterm (204-0pre1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The xterm package has been splitted from the upstream X.Org tree, in
    advance of the upcoming modularization in X.Org 7.0.
  * This first release will go to experimental distribution, in order to test
    if the transition has been successful.
  * Several things have changed, probably the most obvious is that xterm and
    companions are now installed under /usr/bin instead of /usr/X11R6/bin, now
    that we got rid of imake and use autoconf tools.
  * Also, wide fonts and 256-colour support have been added to xterm. It was a
    long awaited feature, I think. Please test if the new xterm fulfill all
    your wishes.
